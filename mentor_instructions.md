# Mentor instructions

---

## Setup

1.  Create react app
2.  Delete all unecessary files
3.  Replace app.css with https://gist.github.com/saussayjesica/c1bfd17803560aaddc8fe373a388ddab
4.  Add google font to index.html
5.  Make file in folder src/data/menuData.js and copy code from https://gist.github.com/saussayjesica/50f6801bcb3b689e777c2c6fc017c0db
6.  Run `npm install` if not already
7.  Delete all code in App.js
8.  Create App component from scratch - import react, create class, render, return, export default etc. Explain JSX and mention it should be wrapped in an enclosing tag

## Create Header component

1.  Make class component and later when we go over state we can make it a stateless functional component
2.  Add the Header into App.js

## Create MenuItem component

1.  Create another class component and hardcode the data for one menu item. Don't make the handleClick method yet
2.  Explain how the component isn't reusable if we hardcode the data. To make it reuseable we need to use props
3.  Import the menuData in the App.js file as well as the menuItem component. Add the following props to menuItem - emoji, label, name, description, price
4.  Assign the data for the first item in the menuData to the props eg. name={menuData[0].name}
5.  Explain how we could have a menuItem in App.js for every item on our menu but this isn't very dynamic. So we want to use the map method so we can dynamically render a menuItem for every item in the data. Explanation for map is in the readme. Make sure you uipdate the props and add a key using the index.

## Adding state

1.  Add state to the App.js file (we add it to App.js because it's used in both menuItem and Order). Order will be an empty array and cost will be 0.
2.  Create the handleUpdate function in App.js. Explain parameters, arguments, setState and concatenate
3.  The button is in MenuItem so when we click on the button we need to call the method in App.js. To do this we will need to pass the method to menuItem as a prop and call the prop with onClick
4.  Use the react devtools to see state updating when the button is clicked

## Order component

1.  Create the order component and only render the code for no items.
2.  To be able to display orders in the order component, we need to pass state down as props. Add an order and total prop and pass down state
3.  We need to add a ternery operator or an if/else statement to check if we have any orders. If orders.length === 0, we display the no items code
4.  Add the remaining code that displays the ordered items. Try to get the students to guess that they need to use map() to display the items dynamically
5.  Add the total section in the order component
6.  Before adding the buttons, add the resetOrder method to app.js and pass this method to the order component as a prop
7.  Add the reset button to the order component and test that it works
8.  Add the submitOrder method to app.js and then pass the method down to Order and add the submit button to the order component

## Lifecycle methods

1.  Briefly explain componentDidMount and how we will use it to fetch the menudata
2.  Add componentDidMount to App.js and create a setTimeout function that saves the menudata to state after 3secs.
3.  Update state with data
4.  Create the loading component
5.  Add a ternary to display the loading if the data isn't ready

## Refactor

1.  Update components that are not using state to stateless functional components
2.  Destructure state and props
3.  Add propTypes
4.  Use hooks
